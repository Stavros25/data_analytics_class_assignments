--are both needed to define unique matches to the da_world.city data. So, add a match to district in your join to retrieve 
-- the data that you want.

--If you also want to show origin cities that have no match to the world data city and state then your query has an issue because it doesn't return those. That's the purpose of inner joinsâ€”to return only rows that have matches between tables. To include the origin cities with no matches in the world city data you need to use other join types, which are explored in the next lesson.
